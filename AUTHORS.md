This file contains the list of people involved in the development of these
scripts, which started as just a bunch of loose file that I kept around
for convenience, and most often than not, just for fun :)

If you feel someone is missing, please fork and pull-request.
You may add your name, email, a link to your personal web-site/blog/profile
(no commercial links) and a brief contribution summary.

<!-- The following list is roughly sorted in reverse cronological order. -->
